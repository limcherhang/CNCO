# final report

This report contains implemented on two paper:
  1. https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05751
  2. https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10461

# New idea

By the two methods proposed in the paper above, I have a new idea that is mix up two methods and do some simple simulation. By the way, I updated implement on the datasets mnist.

# Run the code
To run the code, 

``` console
$ python main.py
```

And get the result on Simultaneous Gradient Descent(SimGA), Consensus Optimization(ConOpt), Negative Curvature Exploitation for Local Saddle Point Problem(CESP) and Consensus Optimization + Negative Curvature Exploitation for Local Saddle Point Problem(ConOpt with CESP).
