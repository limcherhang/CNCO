# final report for structural machine learning and their applications

This report contains implemented on two paper:
  1. https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05751
  2. https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10461

# New idea

By the two methods proposed in the paper above, I have a new idea that is mix up two methods and do some simple simulation. By the way, I will update actually implement on the datasets.
